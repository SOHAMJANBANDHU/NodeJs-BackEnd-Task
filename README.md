# Node.js Backend Development for Interactive User Login System with JWT

## Task Description

The goal of this task is to create a Node.js backend for an interactive user login system utilizing JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication.

## Requirements

1. **Node.js Server Setup**
   - Set up a Node.js server using a framework like Express.js.

2. **User Registration**
   - Implement an endpoint to allow users to register by providing a unique username and password.
   - Store user data securely (e.g., using bcrypt for password hashing).

3. **User Login**
   - Create an endpoint for users to log in using their registered username and password.
   - Generate a JWT upon successful login.

4. **JWT Implementation**
   - Use JWTs to manage user sessions and secure API routes.
   - Verify JWT tokens on protected routes to ensure authentication.

5. **Error Handling**
   - Implement appropriate error handling for different scenarios (e.g., incorrect credentials).

6. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests to ensure the functionality and security of the login system.

7. **Documentation**
   - Provide clear and concise documentation on how to set up and use the backend.

8. **Security Considerations**
   - Implement best practices for securing sensitive information (e.g., passwords, tokens).

9. **Deployment (Optional)**
    - If possible, deploy the backend to a cloud platform or server.
